Hi! My name is Simon, and I'm CTO at Hyphen.

At Hyphen, we have a bold vision to bring personal and private AI to the world. We believe that AI should be used to help people, not to exploit them. We are building a platform that will allow people to use AI to help them in their daily lives, without having to give up their privacy.
We are currently hiring the most talented people we can find to help us bring this vision to life.

My co-founders Yngvi and Kasper are both, like myself, seasoned founders and our values have brought us together for our most amibitious project yet.

Our current team is small, consting of Thomas (Product Manager), Andrei (Senior Fullstack/Architect) and Volodomyr (Senior Trust Engineer), and we are currently hiring for 2 open positions.

When I'm not working, I like spending time with friends and family. Some of my hobbies include running, going to the gym, learning to play piano and playing badminton. I live in Copenhagen, a great city (especially in the summer).

I also spend a lot of time reading and digesting knowledge, like the latest research in AI/ML and Self-Sovereign Identity.

I really don't enjoy writing about myself, but if it can help us find the right Senior ML Engineer, then it's absolutely worth it :-)
